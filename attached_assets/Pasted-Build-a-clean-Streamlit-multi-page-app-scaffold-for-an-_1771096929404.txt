Build a clean Streamlit multi-page app scaffold for an ADHD self-reflection tool called Focus Forge. Use Python + Streamlit only. Do NOT implement the actual tests yet—create placeholder pages with stub completion buttons and dummy metrics that we will replace later.

Hard requirements (Replit + Streamlit)

Use Streamlit’s multipage structure with a /pages folder (preferred for clarity in Replit).

Use only these libraries: streamlit, pandas, plotly (optional), and Python standard library.

All user data is session-only (use st.session_state). No real auth, no DB.

Enforce gating: user cannot access Results until both tests are completed.

App pages (exact flow + gating)
Page 1: Welcome (Sign-in / Guest)

File: pages/01_Welcome.py
UI:

App title + 1-line purpose

Disclaimer (visible): “Not a medical diagnosis. For self-reflection only.”

Two options:

Continue as Guest (one click)

Sign up form with:

display_name (required)

email (optional; no validation beyond “contains @” if provided)
Behavior:

On Guest: set auth_mode="guest", display_name="Guest", user_id (random uuid), then navigate to Test Overview.

On Sign up: set auth_mode="signup", store name/email, set user_id uuid, then navigate to Test Overview.

Session keys to initialize (if missing):

auth_mode, display_name, email, user_id

time_test_done (bool), reaction_test_done (bool)

time_error_sec (float), avg_reaction_ms (int), misses (int)

score (int), label (str), insights (list[str]), coach_text (str)

Page 2: Test Overview (must explain sequence)

File: pages/02_Test_Overview.py
UI:

Explain: user must complete two tests in order to unlock results:

Time Perception Test

Reaction (Attention) Test

Show progress:

Step 1/2: Time test status

Step 2/2: Reaction test status

Buttons:

“Start / Continue Tests” routes:

If time not done → Time Test page

Else if reaction not done → Reaction Test page

Else → Results page

If user is not “authenticated” (no auth_mode), show warning and link back to Welcome.

Page 3: Time Test (placeholder only)

File: pages/03_Time_Test.py
UI:

Brief instructions + “Begin” (no real timer yet)

One primary button: “Mark Time Test Complete (stub)”
Behavior:

On click:

time_test_done = True

time_error_sec = 3.2 (dummy)

Auto-route to Reaction Test page

Prevent access if user not authenticated (send back to Welcome)

Page 4: Reaction Test (placeholder only)

File: pages/04_Reaction_Test.py
UI:

Brief instructions + placeholder

One primary button: “Mark Reaction Test Complete (stub)”
Behavior:

On click:

reaction_test_done = True

avg_reaction_ms = 610 (dummy)

misses = 2 (dummy)

Auto-route to Results page

Prevent access if Time Test isn’t done (send to Test Overview)

Page 5: Results / Dashboard (gated)

File: pages/05_Results.py
Gating:

If both tests not complete, show warning + link to Test Overview, and do not show results.
UI:

“Cognitive Snapshot” section:

Score (computed via stub scoring module; default expected ~72)

Label (from scoring module)

2–3 insight bullets (from scoring module)

Charts:

Simple Plotly bar chart or Streamlit chart using dummy normalized signals derived from the dummy metrics

Coaching:

Button: “Generate 10-min Micro-Plan”

Calls coach.generate_micro_plan(...) (stub) and displays/store in st.session_state.coach_text

Buttons:

“Re-run Snapshot” resets only test + result fields (keeps user identity) and routes to Test Overview

“Reset Session” clears all session state and routes to Welcome

Shared modules (create these files)
constants.py

App name, disclaimers, test names, labels, routing helper strings.

scoring.py

Function:

compute_score(time_error_sec: float, avg_reaction_ms: int, misses: int) -> tuple[int, str, list[str]]
Implementation (stub but deterministic):

Return a stable score (e.g., 72) for the dummy inputs and produce:

label: e.g., “Moderate Time Blindness + Mild Distractibility”

insights: 2–3 bullet strings referencing the metrics

coach.py

Function:

generate_micro_plan(score: int, label: str, insights: list[str], context: str = "Work") -> str
Implementation:

Return a 10-minute plan: 3 numbered steps + 1 coping technique + 1 affirmation + a safety note (“not medical advice”).

Navigation notes (important)

Prefer Streamlit’s st.switch_page("pages/XX_Page.py") for navigation.

Provide a small init_session_state() helper used by every page to avoid KeyErrors.

Deliverables

Return:

The final folder/file structure

Full code for each file:

app.py (optional landing; may just redirect to Welcome)

pages/01_Welcome.py

pages/02_Test_Overview.py

pages/03_Time_Test.py

pages/04_Reaction_Test.py

pages/05_Results.py

constants.py

scoring.py

coach.py

Do NOT add databases, external auth, or real test logic yet. Keep it minimal, clean, and runnable on Replit.
