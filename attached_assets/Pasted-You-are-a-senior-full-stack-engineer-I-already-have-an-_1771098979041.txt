You are a senior full-stack engineer. I already have an app structure in this Replit project. Your task is to IMPLEMENT a new feature called “Time Perception Challenge” as an ADHD screening signal (NOT a diagnosis).

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT change unrelated parts of the app. Keep edits minimal and localized.
- Use the existing routing/navigation patterns in this repo.
- Add a new page/screen/component and wire it into the UI where tests are listed.
- Use high-precision timing: performance.now() (web) / high-resolution timer available in the stack.
- No per-trial feedback; only show results at the end.
- Include a clear disclaimer: “Not a diagnosis; influenced by sleep, stress, caffeine, meds; consider validated screeners + clinician.”

FEATURE SPEC (Time Estimation Task):
1) User sees instructions:
   - “Press START, then press STOP when you think the target time has passed.”
   - “Do NOT count; do NOT use external timers.”
   - “2 practice trials not scored.”
2) Trials:
   - Practice: 2 trials at 6s and 12s (not scored).
   - Scored: 8 trials with randomized targets from [6s, 8s, 10s, 12s, 15s, 20s] (no immediate reveal).
   - Randomize order; prevent two identical targets back-to-back if possible.
3) Each trial UI:
   - Shows target time (e.g., “Target: 12 seconds”)
   - START button → begins timing and disables START
   - STOP button → ends timing
   - After STOP: auto-advance to next trial after 800ms with a neutral “Recorded” state (do not show accuracy).
4) Data capture per trial:
   - target_ms, actual_ms, error_ms (actual-target), abs_error_ms
   - trial_index, is_practice
   - start_timestamp, end_timestamp
5) Scoring:
   - Use ONLY scored trials.
   - Compute:
     a) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in ms
     b) Error Variability = std dev of error_ms
     c) Bias = mean(error_ms) (positive = overestimate, negative = underestimate)
   - Create “Time Control Score” 0–100 (higher is better):
     - Normalize MAE and Variability against reasonable caps (e.g., cap MAE at 6000ms, cap std at 6000ms)
     - Score = 100 - (0.55*norm_MAE + 0.45*norm_STD)*100
     - Clamp to [0,100]
   - Category label (non-medical):
     - 80–100: “Typical timing consistency”
     - 60–79: “Mild inconsistency”
     - 40–59: “Moderate inconsistency”
     - 0–39: “High inconsistency”
6) Results screen:
   - Show Time Control Score, category, and the three metrics (MAE, Variability, Bias)
   - Show a simple table of scored trials: target(s), actual(s), abs error(s)
   - Provide a “Retake test” button (new randomized trials)
   - Provide a “Back to tests” button
7) Persistence:
   - Save the latest result object locally (localStorage or existing persistence layer in this repo).
   - If the app has a user/session concept already, store under that user key; otherwise store a single “latest_time_perception_result”.

DELIVERABLES:
- Implement the new page/component + minimal styling consistent with the app.
- Add/modify routes/navigation so the user can start the test.
- Ensure the code runs without errors.
- After implementation, print a short “What I changed” summary listing files touched and where to click in the UI to run the test.

Start by scanning the repo to detect the framework (React/Next/Vite, Flask templates, etc.) and follow the existing patterns.
